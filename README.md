# 📘 LeetCode Study Log

This is my personal study log as I prepare for software engineering interviews.  
I'm solving top LeetCode problems and documenting my thinking process in both English and Japanese to improve my coding and communication skills.

## 🗣️ Interview Script (Example)

> Problem: Two Sum\
> Approach: Use a hash map to store previously seen numbers.\
> Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).
>
> “I first explain the problem in my own words, then discuss the brute-force idea, and finally explain the optimized solution using a hash map…”
